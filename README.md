# 🎾 Tennis Project – Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes tennis match data to identify patterns, trends, and key factors influencing player performance.  
It follows a structured, end‑to‑end data analysis workflow from raw data exploration to insight generation.

The project is organized into **two Jupyter notebooks**, each serving a clear and distinct purpose.

## 📁 Project Structure



---

## 1️⃣ Tennis_Project.ipynb — Main Analysis Notebook
This notebook contains the **final and well‑structured analysis**.  
It is the primary reference for understanding the project logic and results.

### What is included:
- Dataset loading and initial inspection
- Feature understanding and data structure review
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Handling missing values
  - Correcting data types
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analytical and statistical comparisons
- Visualizations
- Final insights and conclusions

This notebook presents the **complete analysis pipeline** from raw data to conclusions.

---

## 2️⃣ Tennis_Project_Analayst.ipynb — Exploratory / Analyst Notebook
This notebook is used for **exploratory and experimental analysis**.

### Purpose:
- Testing hypotheses and ideas
- Deep‑dive analysis on specific variables
- Trying alternative metrics and visualizations
- Supporting and validating insights used in the main notebook

The code here is more iterative and exploratory and may not be optimized for presentation.

## 🧠 Analysis Logic & Workflow
The overall workflow follows these steps:

1. **Data Understanding**
   - Inspect columns and data types
   - Understand feature meanings
   - Identify data quality issues

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Fix or remove incorrect records
   - Convert data types
   - Prepare datasets for analysis

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution analysis
   - Player‑ and match‑level comparisons
   - Trend and pattern discovery

4. **Focused Analysis**
   - Factors affecting match outcomes
   - Comparisons across players, tournaments, or seasons
   - Statistical or comparative methods

5. **Visualization & Insights**
   - Clear plots for communication
   - Translating numbers into actionable insights

---

## ✅ Why Use Two Notebooks?
- Separates exploration from final analysis
- Keeps the main notebook clean and readable
- Reflects real‑world data analysis workflow
- Improves collaboration and review

---

## 🚀 How to Use
- Start with **`Tennis_Project.ipynb`** for the full analysis and conclusions.
- Refer to **`Tennis_Project_Analayst.ipynb`** for exploratory work and supporting analysis.

---

## 📝 Notes
- Outputs are preserved for easier understanding.
- Large datasets are loaded externally.
- The structure allows easy extension of the analysis.
